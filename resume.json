I spent the past two years self-teaching and then enrolled in the Flatiron School's Full Stack Developer program. I am eagerly working daily towards mastering Node, React, and JavaScript, while improving upon my front-end and Ruby skills. I recently completed a React-Redux application served by a Rails API that utilizes Webpack, Babel, ImmutableJS, Lodash, Material-UI components, and ChartJS.",
